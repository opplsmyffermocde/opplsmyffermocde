Debt consolidation loans are commonly used to pay off outstanding debt balances faster to help save on interest. Borrowers also get the benefit of streamlining the repayment process by combining debts into a single monthly payment.

The idea is to borrow a loan with a lower interest rate than what you currently pay on the debts — credit card, medical and other bills — you plan to consolidate. You’ll use the loan proceeds to pay off those balances and make payments on a new loan product for a set period.
